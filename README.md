# Hackathon Project: UCSC Basic Needs Navigator

## Overview

There are many on-campus basic needs facilities at UCSC, but unfortunately, many of them are underutilized. Students are often unaware of these resources, their locations, and what they offer. This app aims to bridge that gap by providing a platform for facilities to post their available products and a map to help students easily locate them.

Many students struggle to find food pantries and other essential resources simply because of accessibility issues. Eric, who currently works at the Redwood Free Market, frequently encounters students asking about specific products and their availability. This app allows users to:

- View the products available at each facility, including images uploaded by facility staff.
- Navigate to each facility using an integrated map, which can also help students locate donation sites for unused food or goods.
- (In development) Submit questions, comments, or recommendations about each facility. This feature will also allow facilities to maintain an FAQ section and automatically send student inquiries via email. A major challenge Eric's boss faces is determining which new products or programs would be most beneficial to students, and direct student feedback can help address this.

## **Relation to Sustainability and Social Good**

Food and other basic needs insecurities are a more significant issue than the university acknowledges. The Redwood Free Market alone received over 11,000 visits last year, and demand continues to grow. Despite this, surplus food still goes to waste when it could benefit students in need.

This app aims to:

- Make UCSC’s basic needs program more accessible, helping students who were previously unaware of these resources.
- Reduce unnecessary trips to grocery stores, thereby saving fuel and lowering carbon emissions.
- Provide a convenient way for students to donate excess food rather than discarding it. Many people throw away unused goods simply because they lack an easy way to donate them.

By centralizing and simplifying access to these essential resources, this project promotes sustainability, reduces food waste, and ensures that students can meet their basic needs efficiently.
